# rus-example-getter

Looks for a given keyword (Russian Language) to show all examples from a given .txt database of Russian sentences.

This program was designed with the intention of aiding language learners

It is capable of working with any desired languag though, all that needs to be changed is the filename of the .txt sentence examples.

Future updates will be to add a method of saving each searched word's sentences in a <name>.txt file within the same folder,
    and also to provide English translations of all returned examples.
